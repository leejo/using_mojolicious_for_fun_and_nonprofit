A talk planned for the 2014 Swiss perl workshop (and perhaps the 2014 Austrian
perl workshop also, and possibly maybe the 2014 London perl workshop (maybe))

To view the talk slides you will need to install the module App::revealup

Then run:

revealup server presentation.md --port 5000 --theme night --transition none

Slides are then available at http://localhost:5000

examples are in the bin/ directory
