A talk planned for the 2014 Swiss perl workshop (and perhaps the 2014 Austrian
perl workshop also)

To view the talk slides you will need to install the module App::revealup

Then run:

revealup server presentation.md \
	--port 5000 \
	--transition none \
	--width 960 \
	--height 800

Slides are then available at http://localhost:5000

examples are in the bin/ directory
