A talk planned for the 2014 Swiss perl workshop (and perhaps the 2014 Austrian
perl workshop also, and possibly maybe the 2014 London perl workshop (maybe))

To view the talk slides you will need to install the module App::revealup

Then run (server may need to be serve depending on the version of App::revealup):

revealup server presentation.md \
	--port 5000 \
	--transition none \
	--width 960 \
	--height 800

Slides are then available at http://localhost:5000

examples are in the bin/ directory
